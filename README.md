# Perceptron algorithm in python
1. perceptron.py is the general step function activation, with threshold 0.5.

2. or-gate-implemntation is carried out using perceptron algorithm, 3 inputs and bias is given and weights are found using the perceptron algorithm. Graph    is plot to show how the perceptron could linearly seperate the or-gate truth values
