# Perceptron algorithm in python
perceptron.py is the general step function activation, with threshold 0.5.
or-gate-implemntation is carried out using perceptron algorithm, 3 inputs and bias is given and weights are found using the perceptron algorithm. Graph is plot to show how the perceptron could linearly seperate the or-gate truth values
